# Apollo Framework

The Apollo framework is a toolkit for building stable and robust server software.

 **Apollo** was extracted out of [Jupiter](https://github.com/scireum/jupiter) to make its
core parse usable by other libraries or applications.

Apollo provides a small **dependency injection helper** called *Platform** along with some
tooling to setup logging, format messages and to react on signals. This is commonly required
to properly run inside a Docker container.
